# Advanced Data Curation 

An advanced course suggests that there is some basic competencies that both the students and instructor bring to the class. This course in particular builds upon the INFX 551 Foundations of Data Curation to take an in-depth look at both applying curation skills to emerging topics, and continuing to develop skills to curate diverse forms of digital outputs (software, cultural heritage objects, unstructured data, etc.). 

### Topics (up for revision)

For Spring 2018 we will look at three particular emerging topics in data curation (choosing from the four below): 

1. Open Data / Smart Cities 
- Curating public sector data
- Licensing and open data
- Smart Cities and Surveillance Capitalism 
- Public records, FOIA, and proactive vs reactive transparency

2. Privacy sensitive data curation 
- General Data Protection Regulation and changing landscape of PII 
- Privacy by Design - how does this impact curation work? 
- Human Subject Protections and the new IRB

3. Sustainability in a Data-Driven Fourth Estate
- Data journalism has a citation and reproducibility problem

4. Social Media Curation 
- Who owns a post?
- How do we curate data we can't download? What are the protections / legalities of scraping data from these platforms? 
- IP around Images and Imaging
- Tracking provenance in dynamic social media platforms. 
- Public records on social media platforms 

### Format 
The goal for each topic is to create a "primer" for data curators. This will require us to spend 2-3 weeks searching for literature, reading, discussing, and summarizing each topic until we have a good handle on the major issues, the points of debate and contention, and the future directions for curating data in this area.
